abstract="This paper presents a model for building cluster distribution analysis based on the Delaunay triangulation skeleton. The skeleton connection within the gap area among the building polygons obtains a special geometric construction similar to Voronoi diagram that spatially partitions the gap area equally. Each building polygon is surrounded by a partitioning polygon which can be regarded as the growth region of inner building. Based on this model, several cluster structure variables can be computed, such as the distribution density, the topological neighbour, the adjacent distance and the adjacent direction. Considering the constraints of position accuracy, statistical area balance, orthogonal shape in building generalization, the study presents a progressive algorithm of building cluster aggregation, including the conflict detection (where), the object (who) displacement and the geometric combination (how). The algorithm has been realized in a generalization system and some experiment illustrations are provided in the paper.",
